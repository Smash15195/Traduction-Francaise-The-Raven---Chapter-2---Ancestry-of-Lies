spokentexts_a14_butler_top_a14_butler_bombe_tseq_st_3;I wanted to dispose of Legrand. As spectacularly as possible!
spokentexts_a14_butler_top_a14_butler_bombe_tseq_st_4;You almost disposed of ME as well!

spokentexts_a14_butler_top_a14_butler_der_plan_tseq_st_3;We will steal the second Eye in Cairo - before the eyes of the world!
spokentexts_a14_butler_top_a14_butler_der_plan_tseq_st_4;The theft of the first Eye got everyone's attention. Legrand's death would have increased the excitement immeasurably...

spokentexts_a14_butler_top_a14_butler_verabschieben_tseq_st_6;Ah, well... I'd prefer that no one see you while you're on board.
spokentexts_a14_butler_top_a14_butler_verabschieben_tseq_st_7;Smuggle yourself on board and stay undercover until Cairo.
spokentexts_a14_butler_top_a14_butler_verabschieben_tseq_st_8;Okay.
spokentexts_a14_butler_top_a14_butler_verabschieben_tseq_st_9;And no more games.
