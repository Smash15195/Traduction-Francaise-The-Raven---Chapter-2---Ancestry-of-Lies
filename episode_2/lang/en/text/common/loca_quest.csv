text_quest01_slot01_titel;Persuade Legrand
text_quest01_slot01_content;I have to convince Legrand that I can be of use. Helping the professor open his door would be a good start...
text_quest01_slot02_content;Reuniting the baroness with her purse would earn me a few points with Legrand.
text_quest02_slot01_titel;Open the professor's door
text_quest02_slot01_content;The door to Professor Lucien's compartment is locked — from the inside, it seems. I have to find a way to open the lock.
text_quest02_slot02_content;The toolbox might come in handy for opening Professor Lucien's door. All I need is the key.
hint_quest02_slot02;The railroad employees must have access to the key.
text_quest02_slot03_content;I have to find a way to open the locked drawer behind the bar. Maybe there's a key to the compartments in there.
hint_quest02_slot03;Maybe the other passengers have an idea how I can open the drawer.
text_quest03_slot01_titel;Analyze fingerprints
hint_quest03_slot01;Maybe I can somehow analyze the fingerprints on the window of the archeologist‘s compartment!
text_quest04_slot01_titel;Find the baroness's purse
text_quest04_slot01_content;The baroness commissioned me to find her purse. Not quite the crime of the century, if it's even a crime at all. But it's my job as a policeman.
hint_quest04_slot01;I should ask the other passengers if they know where the purse might be.
text_quest04_slot02_content;Lady Westmacott's companion said that her son Matt might be able to help me. But where's the little fellow run off to?
text_quest04_slot03_content;Matt's upset because I took his pistol away. If he'd only talk to me, I could ask him about the baroness' purse. 
hint_quest04_slot03;I can't give him his pistol back, but maybe there's another way	 to cheer him up.
text_quest04_slot04_content;Matt saw the violinist pick up and pocket something on the platform...
text_quest04_slot05_content;The violinist claims he knows nothing about the purse. If only I could get a look inside his violin case...
hint_quest04_slot05;Maybe I can distract him somehow, so that he'll leave his violin case unattended for a while.
text_quest05_slot01_titel;Uncouple freight car
text_quest05_slot01_content;I have to uncouple the freight car before the smoke in the tunnel suffocates us.
text_quest05_slot02_content;I can't make heads or tails of the coupling mechanism in the dark. I need more light!
text_quest05_slot03_content;Matches won't do — I need a better source of light.
hint_quest05_slot03;Maybe I can make a torch somehow.
text_quest05_slot04_content;The torch isn't burning very brightly and it goes out at the slightest movement. I need to make a larger flame.
hint_quest05_slot04;Is there wax or oil or anything of that sort around here?
text_quest06_slot01_titel;Talk to Matt
text_quest06_slot01_content;I found Matt, but he's terrified. I have to calm him down somehow.
hint_quest06_slot01;If Matt feels like he can defend himself, he might calm down.
text_quest06_slot02_titel;Uncouple engine
text_quest06_slot02_content;The engine won't stop on its own and I can't get into the cab because of the fire.
text_quest06_slot03_content;The door is too hot to touch with my bare hands. I need to find something that will protect me from the heat.
text_quest06_slot04_content;The smoke and embers are too much for me. I need to protect my face.
text_quest07_slot01_titel;Board the ship
text_quest07_slot01_content;Legrand doesn't want to let me on the ship. I have to find some way to come along.
hint_quest07_slot01;I should take a good look around the pier.
text_quest07_slot02_content;The suspicious trunk that I noticed while they were loading the ship must be in the cargo hold somewhere. Is that how the Raven got on board?
text_quest08_slot01_titel;Get free
text_quest08_slot01_content;Who knocked me out and tied me up? And more importantly: how can I free myself?
hint_quest08_slot01;I might be a bit tied up at the moment, but that doesn't mean I can't reach nearby objects...
text_quest08_slot02_content;Someone seems to have shot at a crate. I think the bullet is still stuck in the wood, but I can't pry it out with my fingers.
text_quest08_slot03_content;I can't open the door with my bare hands. Maybe I need a tool of some sort.
text_quest08_slot04_content;The ship set sail while I was unconscious — I'm officially a passenger now...
text_quest08_slot05_titel;Raven hunting
text_quest08_slot05_content;A black-clad figure was sighted on the roof. Could it be the Raven?
hint_quest08_slot05;I should look around the port side.

text_quest09a_slot01_titel;Who is the murderer?
text_quest09a_slot01_content;Still no suspect in the baroness' murder. I'll see if I can get some useful information from the other passengers.
text_quest09a_slot02_content;I'm looking for clues that could lead us to the killer.
hint_quest09a_slot02;Maybe the gunshot I heard in the cargo hold is connected to the murder.
text_quest09a_slot03_content;Legrand gave me permission to search the baroness' cabin.
hint_quest09a_slot03;I should search the cabin thoroughly for clues.
text_quest09a_slot04_content;I think there's more than just feathers stuck in the vase, but my hand's too big to reach in.

text_quest09b_slot05_titel;Examine the stain of blood
text_quest09b_slot05_content;The spot of blood on the mattress looks strange.
hint_quest09b_slot05;If I take a sample of the blood, I can examine it in more detail.
text_quest09b_slot08_content;Enter the sick bay

text_quest09c_slot06_titel;Talk to the stowaway
text_quest09c_slot06_content;Constable Oliver doesn't want to let me talk to the stowaway in the hold. I have to distract him somehow.
hint01_quest09c_slot06;Maybe he'll leave his place if he has to deal with bodily needs...
hint02_quest09c_slot06;Matt has a better head for pranks than I do.

text_quest09_slot07_content;I could examine the evidence on my own in Legrand's cabin.
hint01_quest09_slot07;Did the bullets from the cargo hold and the baroness' cabin come from the same gun?
hint02_quest09_slot07;Why does the blood on the baroness' bed look so strange?

text_quest10_slot01_titel;Search for clues
text_quest10_slot01_content;Maybe I'll find more clues in the medical facility.
text_quest10_slot02_content;Doctor Gebhardt tied me up and intends to kill me. I have to act fast.
hint_quest10_slot02;Maybe I can stall for time...
text_quest11_slot01_titel;Look around
text_quest11_slot01_content;I should use the time before the safe arrives to have a look around.
text_quest11_slot02_titel;Enter treasure chamber
text_quest11_slot02_content;The treasure chamber gate is locked.  I need to find a way to open it.
text_quest11_slot03_content;The gate's mechanism is stuck. I need to find a way to at least open it a crack.
text_quest11_slot04_content;A single pole isn't enough to lift the gate.
hint_quest11_slot04;Maybe there's another pole around here somewhere.
text_quest12_slot01_titel;Enter the basement
text_quest12_slot01_content;The display case with the Eye fell into a hole as a result of the explosion. I need to get down there and see if the stone is still there.
text_quest12_slot02_titel;Open secret door
text_quest12_slot02_content;I have to find out what's behind the secret door before the police arrive and open the gates.
text_quest12_slot03_content;What does the writing on the secret door mean?
hint_quest03_slot03;Maybe the director of the museum can translate it for me.
text_quest12_slot04_content;“The Sons of Horus”. Man, baboon, jackal and falcon.  
hint_quest04_slot04;I can probably find out more about the Sons of Horus in the museum.
text_quest13_slot01_titel;Get on the train
text_quest13_slot01_content;I have to get on the train somehow, but just walking right on is not an option.
text_quest13_slot02_content;I can't let anyone see me getting on the train. 
hint_quest13_slot02;As long as the policeman is talking to the doctor I won't be able to get on unseen.
text_quest14_slot01_titel;Leave the compartment
text_quest14_slot01_content;I need to get out of the compartment unseen — but I can't use the door as long as there are people out there.
text_quest14_slot02_titel;Examine freight car
text_quest14_slot02_content;The view into the freight car is blocked. I need to find a way to get a look inside.
hint_quest14_slot02;A mirror might come in handy.
text_quest14_slot03_titel;Open porthole on roof 
text_quest14_slot03_content;The porthole on the roof of the freight car is bolted shut. I need tools to open it.
text_quest14_slot04_content;The nut that fell down almost gave me away. I need to prevent it from happening again.
hint_quest14_slot04;Maybe I can hold onto the second nut somehow so that it doesn't fall down when I unscrew the bolt.
text_quest15_slot01_titel;Escape the trunk
text_quest15_slot01_content;I can't get the lid of the trunk open. I need to get out of here somehow.
text_quest15_slot02_content;I can't get more than one arm though the slot in the lid, but maybe I can reach something useful.
text_quest15_slot03_content;I've cut the strap, but the trunk is still on the shelf.
hint_quest15_slot03;If the shelf won't move, maybe I can at least move the trunk.
text_quest15_slot04_content;The strap didn't anchor itself on the shelf, it just knocked over some objects 
text_quest15_slot05_content;Maybe there's a way to get at the pipe.
hint_quest15_slot05;Perhaps I can go “fishing”...
text_quest15_slot06_content;I have the pipe, but I'm still stuck in the trunk.

text_quest16a_slot01_titel;Enter the baroness' cabin
text_quest16a_slot01_content;I need to get into the baroness' cabin and open her secret compartment.
text_quest16a_slot02_content;I can't just enter through the door. The risk of being caught is too great.
text_quest16a_slot03_content;The ventilation shaft would be ideal, but it's bolted shut.
hint_quest16a_slot03;There might be tools in our cabin.
text_quest16a_slot04_content;I can't apply enough force on the penny to turn it with my bare hands. I need more leverage.
text_quest16a_slot05_content;As long as there's no way to get back up without leaving clues behind, I won't climb down into the cabin.
hint_quest16a_slot05;: I need something I can use to climb down.

text_quest16b_slot06_titel;Open secret compartment
text_quest16b_slot06_content;The secret hiding place must be somewhere in the cabin — but where?
text_quest16b_slot07content;Adil was right. I need to enter a combination to open the secret compartment.
text_quest16b_slot08_content;Maybe the other passengers know something useful.
hint01_quest16b_slot08;Every clue might help me in conversation with the other passengers.
hint02_quest16b_slot08;Adil might also be able to help.

text_quest17_slot01_titel;Leave the cell
text_quest17_slot01_content;No more victims. I need to get out of this cell and warn Constable Zellner.
hint_quest17_slot01;Maybe I can reach something outside the cell that will help me.
text_quest17_slot02_titel;Leave the cargo hold
text_quest17_slot02_content;Both doors in the hold are locked. There must be another way out.
text_quest17_slot03_content;I can't remove the grid with my bare hands. Maybe there's a way to pry it off.
hint_quest17_slot03;The crane might come in handy, but I can't attach it directly to the bars.
text_quest18_slot01_titel;Find Doctor Gebhardt
text_quest18_slot01_content;Where is Doctor Gebhardt? I have to find him!
text_quest19_slot01_titel;Enter museum 
text_quest19_slot01_content;I need to get into the museum somehow in order to obtain the hidden blueprints for the treasure chamber.
text_quest19_slot02_content;The guard won't let me into the museum. I have to persuade him that I'm permitted to enter.
hint_quest19_slot02;It seems like part of the museum is being renovated. Maybe I can pretend to be a craftsman.
text_quest19_slot03_content;Damn, the name on the stolen clothes isn't on the list of craftsmen.
text_quest19_slot04_content;I can't get in via the roof at the moment. Maybe I'll find a way once I have the blueprints.
text_quest19_slot05_content;There's a note next to the roof on the blueprints. Maybe that's my way into the museum.
hint01_quest19_slot05;The same symbol appears on the blueprints and the chimney. Maybe the numbers next to it also have something to do with the chimney.
hint02_quest19_slot05;They read from right to left in Arabic-speaking countries.
text_quest20_slot01_titel;Light in the basement
text_quest20_slot01_content;I can't see much in the darkness of the basement. I need to get light somehow.
text_quest20_slot02_content;Light switch, cable, socket… everything is prepared. I just need to get the rust off the light bulbs electrical contacts.
hint_quest20_slot02;I don't have sandpaper with me, but maybe I can find a similar abrasive surface to do the job.
text_quest20_slot03_titel;Open window
text_quest20_slot03_content;I need to open the window, but the alarm will go off as soon as the electrical contacts are separated.
hint_quest20_slot03;Maybe there's a way to bridge the circuit?
text_quest20_slot04_titel;Open display case
text_quest20_slot04_content;I'm in the treasure chamber but there's still the bulletproof glass of the display case between the Eye and me.
hint_quest20_slot04;Maybe I can use something to break the glass.
index_note_start_01;Return of the raven?
a00_common_01_diary;This is the private notebook of Constable Anton Jakob Zellner. Should you find this book, please send it directly to Zurich Police Headquarters.
a00_common_02_museum;23 Sept. 1963 \n A rather valuable ruby was stolen from the British Museum in London. One of the two legendary “Eyes of the Sphinx”. The press is in a tizzy, as one might expect. They blame the “New Raven” for besmirching the reputation of the old RavenRaven père , as the latter never harmed a soul during his exploits.
a00_common_03_task;24 Sept. 1963 \n I did it! I stood up and told the captain right to his face that I — I! — want the assignment. He was too shocked to say no. Inspector Nicolas Legrand, here, with us, in Switzerland! An opportunity I simply cannot pass up. But just what does he want here?
a00_common_04_newspaper_a;London Post, 11 Sept. 1963 \n Legrand Hunts “Raven's Heir”! \n According to information obtained by this newspaper, Nicolas Legrand, 33, a French citizen and Interpol Special Investigator, has taken over the case of the “Raven's Heir”. Legrand is renowned among colleagues in police forces across Europe as an incisive investigator and a relentless bloodhound. He first demonstrated his talents five years ago when the young policeman surprised the world by catching the Raven, the most wanted criminal in all of Europe. A shootout erupted while he attempted to apprehend the wily thief, resulting in the death of the burglar. 
a00_common_04_newspaper_b;The Raven, it must be said, was greatly esteemed by the public for his clever, daring robberies. \n A copycat criminal has plagued us for several months now — though the imitator leaves raven feathers at the scenes of his crimes, his thefts exhibit none of the original Raven's refinement and gamesmanship. The last three robberies have resulted in a total of five casualties, one of them severely injured, though by the grace of God no deaths. \n Scotland Yard, Interpol and Inspector Legrand could not be reached for comment. 
index_note_inspektor_01;Inspector Nicolas Legrand
a00_inspektor_dialog_01;Legrand looks different in person. Older, more worn. He's still a successful detective. But there are rumors that his methods in recent years have become, shall we say, reckless.
a05_inspektor_note_inWater_01;He wants to find the Raven at all costs. He's willing to risk his career to do so. He could simply rest on his laurels until he retires. Yet that's the last thing he'd consider. He needs to prove himself. A truly awe-inspiring opponent. And as an ally...  
a05_inspektor_raven_back_01;Legrand believes he may have shot the wrong man in Paris all those years ago! He thinks it's possible that the old Raven is still alive — and that he's returned!
a07_inspektor_writer_ta_inspektor_01;Lady Westmacott says that Legrand has a driven look. I noticed it as well. This hunt for the Raven — it's not just a job for him. It's something more... 
a07_inspektor_drugs_01;I caught Legrand injecting himself with something. Some kind of stimulant. Might explain his mood swings.
a10_inspektor_a10_start_01;Legrand seems convinced that Dr. Gebhardt was the Raven — and the old Raven, at that. Something doesn't sit right with me — Legrand let himself be persuaded too easily...
a11_inspektor_not_ambassy_01;Legrand said he'd go to the French embassy. But Constable Oliver said that wasn't the case. One of them is lying, that's clear — but why?
index_note_legrands_trap_01;Legrand's trap
a00_legrands_trap_talkto_01;Legrand seems to be laying a trap for the new Raven. I should try to find out more about his plans...
a01_legrands_trap_wagon_01;Inspector Legrand and Constable Robert Oliver of Scotland Yard are guarding a safe in the freight car. Will the Raven really allow himself to be lured in? And even then, will the two of them be able to catch him? I have my doubts...
a02_legrands_trap_bomb_01;A bomb! There was a bomb in the safe! \n He very nearly blew us all to smithereens, the damned criminal! \n Legrand blames himself for not having checked the cashbox. But I don't think he's right to do so. The Raven must have planted the bomb in the box before it was placed in the safe at the bank — an incredible feat! And the letter — how did he manage to place the letter on the safe with three people standing nearby? \n The purpose of the attack is clear enough, though. The Raven wanted Legrand out of the way in order to be able to swipe the second Eye at his leisure. But he's achieved just the opposite — Legrand won't give up. That's obvious. And I, too, have a new reason to bring that criminal to justice!
a05_legrands_trap_terrorist_01;Constable Oliver accuses me of planting the letter. He says that only he, Inspector Legrand and I were present... He does have a point there...
index_note_fiddler_01;The Violinist
index_note_fiddler_02;The Violinist (David Kreutzer)
a01_fiddler_whoishe_01;There's a man with a violin case sitting in the saloon car. \n He claims to be a soloist. Seems to be rather worse for the wear. His hand shakes. \n On his way to Venice, he says. Then on to Cairo by ship to give a concert at the Egyptian Museum.
a01_fiddler_wallet_01;He took advantage of the opportunity and pocketed the purse. Seems to have money trouble. To say nothing of questionable morals. A dangerous combination.
a01_fiddler_writer_ta_fiddler_01;Lady Westmacott considers Kreutzer to be the sort of man who leaches off of others.
a07_fiddler_pistol_01;Kreutzer claims he was drunk last night and no longer recalls what transpired. The murder weapon belongs to him. A Luger 08. Is he really such a drunkard? Or is it just an act? And then there's the possibility that someone's trying to pin it all on him. That would explain why they didn't toss the Luger into the sea — to cast suspicion on the violinist.
index_note_indy_01;Professor Edgar Lucien
a01_indy_first_talk_01;I made the acquaintance of Professor Lucien from London's British Museum. He claims that the robbery at the museum hardly affected him. I don't believe him. He seems rather nervous.
a01_indy_baroness_ta_indy_01;Baroness von Trebitz said that Professor Lucien is an Egyptologist and also head of the museum's Egyptian department. The stolen Eye of the Sphinx was under his purview. He mentioned none of that to me. He lied to me, in fact. What's he hiding?
a07_indy_forecastle_01;Professor Lucien seems to feel something for Ms. Miller. Even his nerves seem calmer... Or they did until I made it clear that there may still be a thief and a murderer on board. At that he quickly took his leave and went to his cabin.
a10_indy_eye_01;The good professor took possession of the Eye of the Sphinx in London and hid it. He was afraid that the safe was not, in fact, safe. Brave, but foolish. If someone had got wind of what he'd done, it would have been all too easy to get the jewel from him. \n But that certainly would explain why the professor was so nervous on the train and on the ship. And I can cross him off my list of suspects. He'd already stolen the gem, in effect — if he really wanted it for himself, he wouldn't have returned it.
index_note_closed_door_01;The locked compartment
a01_closed_door_01;The door to Professor Lucien's compartment is locked. From the outside? Or from the inside? And who locked it in the first place?
a01_closed_door_open_window_01;I think the door was locked from the inside and that whoever locked it escaped through the window. If I'm right, then there really is a thief on the train.
a01_closed_door_button_01;I found a button in the compartment. Might be a clue. Or it might be nothing.
index_note_butler_01;James the Butler
a01_butler_first_talk_01;Baroness von Trebitz and her butler have their own luxury compartment on the train. In my considered opinion, though, there's not a compartment on any train in the world large enough to share with the baroness. Her butler James must have the patience of a saint.
a01_butler_wound_01;James suffered an injury to his right arm. Says it's an old war wound. Seems like the arm isn't completely lame, but he can't move it much. He makes do as best he can. 
a07_butler_staircase_talk_01;James is worried about the consequences for his career if the murderer isn't caught. The baroness' death in itself doesn't seem to concern him much. Possibly because he's only been in her service for a couple of months.
index_note_missing_wallet_01;Missing purse
a01_missing_wallet_first_01;A missing purse — not exactly the case of the century. And I can't imagine that the Raven's somehow mixed up in it. All the same, I'm a police officer and I really should make an effort to find the purse.
a01_missing_wallet_found_01;I suspect the baroness lost her purse and that Kreutzer, the violinist, found and pocketed it. Or could he be a pickpocket? Whatever the case may be, he's committed a crime.
a01_missing_wallet_checked_01;I couldn't resist taking a peek in the purse. Shouldn't have, of course. It's hardly my place as a representative of the state to go riffling through other people's things. And it didn't reveal any new clues.
index_note_baroness_01;Baroness von Trebitz
a01_baroness_first_01;The baroness seems accustomed to being the center of attention. A trying person in my estimation. But also a generous philanthropist. She travels the world, supporting museums and galleries. It's she who's financing the exhibition in Cairo: the first time in centuries that both Eyes of the Sphinx will be displayed together. 
a07_baroness_dead_01;Baroness von Trebitz has been murdered. Terrible. The first corpse I've seen up close. She was lying in a pool of her own blood on her bed. Even though I could hardly stand at the time, it's a sight I'll never forget.
a07_baroness_butler_talk_01;The baroness was an alcoholic and a diabetic. And yet she never went to a doctor. Seems as though she had something of an aversion to the people dressed in white. She was rather disorganized and, according to her butler, the mess of photos in her cabin was her own doing.
a07_baroness_diary_01;The baroness suffered a heavy loss. She wrote of nightmares in her diary and she carried the past with her in her many photographs. I suspect her family was killed in the war.
a07_baroness_why_01;I don't know what the doctor's motive is, but I suspect it's tied up with their mutual past.
index_note_writer_01;Lady Clarissa Westmacott
a01_writer_first_talk_01;I just adore her! To me, she's the greatest author of the century! And certainly the most successful.  \n It's such a shame that she stopped writing. Haven't read anything about it in the press yet. Fans around the world will be in an uproar when they find out! \n Clarissa Westmacott's most successful mysteries: \n Little Indians \n Death on the Rails \n Murder in Egypt \n Under a Full Moon \n Style's Affair of Mystery \n The Vicarage in the Mirror \n Maurice Partout's Easter\n Little Indians sold more than 100 million copies, making it the most successful mystery novel of all time.
a07_writer_ta_boy_01;Lady Westmacott really cares about Mrs. Miller and especially Matt. She also knows a surprising amount of their history. I can't imagine her taking such an interest in all of her employees!
a10_writer_ta_boy_02;Lady Westmacott is Matt's grandmother! She has a son from whom she's estranged. He married a young American woman and they moved to the USA. She had a son.  \n That explains why Lady Westmacott is so interested in Matt. Maybe she wants to make up for what happened with her son.
index_note_caretaker_boy_01;Mary Miller and Matt Miller
a01_caretaker_boy_woodpistol_01;Ms. Miller was introduced to me as Lady Westmacott's “companion”.  I think she's really more of a carer. She seems rather tense. Nervous and a bit unbalanced. Maybe it has something to do with her son, Matt? \n I like Matt. He's a lively, inquisitive boy. But it seems like his mother's got her hands full dealing with him.
a01_caretaker_boy_father_01;Ms. Miller and Matt's father seem to be separated. It seems like the boy blames her for it. Lady Westmacott really seems to like Matt. She's paying for a good education for him.
a03_caretaker_boy_why_train_01;The boy couldn't control himself and slipped onto the train to get his wooden pistol back. That was dangerous and courageous and adventurous... I want to be cross with him, but I can't.
a07_caretaker_boy_romance_01;Seems like something of a romance is brewing between Ms. Miller and Professor Lucien — and Matt doesn't seem terribly pleased about it. Maybe he doesn't want to share his mother... Or maybe he wants to protect her.
a10_caretaker_boy_romance_02;Professor Lucien will accompany Ms. Miller on the Nile cruise. One can never be certain in such matters, but I do believe the two of them have a chance...
a10_caretaker_boy_romance_03;The romance between Ms. Miller and Professor Lucien ended before it really began. Who knows, maybe that's for the best...
index_note_doctor_01;Doctor Gebhardt
a01_doctor_first_talk_01;I already spoke to Doctor Gebhardt in Zurich. He's a German doctor. Planning on finishing up his career in Italy. I can't say I found him particularly likeable. He's polite and courteous, but I don't really think his friendliness is genuine. Something's off.
a05_doctor_talk_pier_01;Doctor Gebhardt seems to have high hopes for his new job — his new life, really. And he advised me to take it easy. If I take care of myself, my heart will keep up for a few more years. But would that be any way to spend my last years?
a07_doctor_blood_01;The blanket in the baroness' cabin was soaked in fake blood. Why didn't Doctor Gebhardt notice? And where's the blanket now?
a09_doctor_murder_01;It was Doctor Gebhardt! HE murdered the baroness — and he wanted to do me in as well. He drugged me; I barely escaped with my life. He said that I wanted to pin something on him, that I planted clues, and asked me why I couldn't just leave him in peace. I think he's mad.
a10_doctor_missing_01;There's no trace of Doctor Gebhardt. Maybe he leapt into the sea, as he wrote in his suicide note. But maybe he's still alive...
index_note_constable_01;Constable Robert Oliver
a01_constable_first_01;The constable seems to be an honest man, but not a clever one. He worships Legrand, that much is clear. He's proud to be working at the side of the great detective. To be honest, I'd feel the same in his place. 
a01_constable_read_01;Constable Oliver was in the British Museum the night of the robbery! Most curious... He was just a stone's throw from the Raven when he stole the first Eye. And now he's supposed to be guarding the other one?
a07_constable_first_dialog_01;The constable's none too pleased that I'm on board. I think he's jealous. HE wants to be Legrand's right-hand man. It's not as though I'm after his job. I'd rather lead than follow.
a10_constable_guard_01;I surprised Constable Oliver standing over an unconscious guard in the guardroom. I don’t know if he knocked him out or not. But isn’t it strange that every time the Raven strikes, Constable Oliver is there as well?
index_note_dark_figure_01;Shadow on the train
a05_dark_figure_train_01;Matt saw a shadowy figure on the train. Could it have been the new Raven? Someone must have placed the letter on the safe, that much is clear. But the Raven paid accomplices in the old days. Maybe the new Raven does the same? \n The shadow lost a ticket for a Mediterranean cruise. Its final destination: Cairo. I think I know what else will be on board. 
a06_dark_figure_talk_constable_01;Another shadow! Constable Oliver spotted it this time. Could it be the same person?
index_note_three_keys_01;Three keys
a05_three_keys_talk_safe_01;According to Legrand, the safe transporting the Eye of the Sphinx to Cairo is secured by three locks. Professor Lucien, Baroness von Trebitz and Dr. Mokhtar, the director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, each have one. \n We have to assume that the Raven already managed to make an impression of the professor's key on the train. He may also have already copied the director's key. That just leaves Baroness von Trebitz's key…
a07_three_keys_third_01;Legrand fooled everyone! He took the third key from the baroness. Supposedly because he was worried about her messiness. Regardless, the third key was never really in danger. But the baroness is dead now and Legrand must ask himself if he's to blame. He led us all to believe that SHE had the third key.
a10_three_keys_legrand_01;The three keys were useless. The safe was empty. Professor Lucien managed to pocket the Eye of the Sphinx at the bank and only pretended to place it in the safe.
index_note_old_raven_01;Old Raven / New Raven
a05_old_raven_tw_investigator_01;Inspector Legrand harbors the suspicion that he shot the wrong man five years ago. If that's true, then the Raven may have returned after all. Legrand's evidence: the raven feather, the handwriting in the letter and the fact that the writer addressed him as “Nico”, something only the old Raven did. 
a05_old_raven_tw_investigator_02;But does that amount to persuasive evidence? Not for me. Everyone knows that the Raven used raven feathers as his symbol. Handwriting can be faked. And anyone involved with the case back then could have known — and revealed — that the Raven teased Legrand by calling him Nico. \n The modus operandi just doesn't match, he has to see that! The old Raven was always careful that no one was injured during his heists. The new Raven tried to blow us all to kingdom come. I think Legrand, bloodhound that he is, is barking up the wrong tree.
a05_old_raven_doctor_confession_01;The doctor's confession has given me a lot of food for thought. My gut feeling is that he's not responsible for everything. But I don't have any evidence to back that up. \n The note is also interesting for another reason. It proves that whoever really is behind it all was present at the alleged death of the Raven five years ago. Has the old Raven returned from the grave like the newspapers claim?
a10_old_raven_article_01;Editorial \n The spectacular developments in the case of the “Eyes of the Sphinx” (see front page as well as pages 3, 5 and 9) just go to show: once a criminal, always a criminal. Many of us, this newspaper included, minimized the gravity of some of the Raven's crimes over the course of his career, preferring to see them as clever games and daring feats. For some, he was a kind of hero, leading the police around by the nose for our amusement. \n And yet now we must all own up to having cheered for a murderer. A man who endangered lives with bombs and who has killed at least once. \n Criminals are and remain just that: criminals. We as a society cannot permit ourselves to forget that fact ever again. \n Rupert Turner, Editor in Chief 
index_note_captain_01;Captain di Conti
a05_captain_tw_doctor_01;According to Doctor Gebhardt, the captain of the Lydia is an old war hero. But he's fallen into poor health of late. Apparently he's been shuffled off to this post.
a07_captain_ship_01;The ship doesn't seem to be all that well maintained. Used to be a freighter; repurposed as a troop transport during the war; refitted yet again as a cruise ship. Its age is apparent. But that's not all. I don't get the impression that Captain DiConti really has his men under control. They only seem to do the bare minimum.
index_note_stowaway_01;The stowaway
a06_stowaway_start_01;A stowaway managed to, well, stow away in a chest of clothing aboard the Lydia, and then knock me out. But who is he? The Raven? One of the Raven's accomplices? Or someone else entirely?
a07_stowaway_captured_01;Our stowaway is a young man of Arabian roots. Constable Oliver spotted him on the upper deck and Legrand took him into custody there. He claims he just wanted some fresh air. I don't believe him. I think it's him I have to thank for the bump on my head. \n What we do know is that Baroness von Trebitz was shot while we were busy with the stowaway. Is the stowaway working with the murderer? Was he meant to distract us?
a07_stowaway_dialog_01;The stowaway says his name is Adil. And of course, he didn't attack me and, indeed, couldn't even hurt a fly. He's lying, of course. But is he lying because he just wants to go home, as he claims? Or did he create a diversion at the behest of the murderer?
index_note_shot_01;Gunshot in the cargohold
a06_shot_start_01;Someone fired a gun in the hold! Who fired, who they were aiming at, and why: all questions I cannot answer.
a07_shot_found_projectile_01;Whoever it was, they shot at a crate. So the bullet wasn't meant for me. And the bullet was still stuck in the wood. So it wasn't about the bullet either.
a07_shot_compared_01;The bullet in the cargo hold was fired by the same gun used to shoot the baroness!
a08_shot_tape_01;Someone recorded the gunshot on an audiotape! It was never about hitting a target — it was about capturing the “bang”!
index_note_murder_baroness_01;The murder of Baroness von Trebitz
a07_murder_baroness_first_01;The baroness was murdered while Legrand, Constable Oliver and Doctor Gebhardt were searching for the shadow that the constable spotted. We heard the shot and moments later we were at the baroness' cabin. The door was locked from the inside and the baroness was dead. She was lying on her bed in a pool of blood. Doctor Gebhardt pronounced her dead but couldn't say anything further about the circumstances. 
a07_murder_baroness_talk_doctor_01;According to Doctor Gebhardt, the baroness was shot in the heart at close range. A single shot. She died instantly.
a07_murder_baroness_anasthetic_01;Was the baroness drugged before she was murdered? She was quite unsteady and seemed very drowsy when we met her on the stairs. 
a09_murder_baroness_motiv_01;Doctor Gebhardt shot Baroness von Trebitz. I still don't know his motive. If I had to guess, I'd say it had something to do with the war and with the baroness' deceased family members.
index_note_backout_01;Unconsciousness
a07_blackout_first_01;I fell unconscious last night. When I left the saloon with the others, I wasn't feeling all that well... and it only got worse from there. I finally collapsed on the side deck, just as the fire alarm went off. 
a07_blackout_anastethic_law_01;There was a tranquilizer in the champagne that I drank last night in the saloon. That explains the drowsiness and the unconsciousness. Was Baroness von Trebitz also drugged? She was unsteady on her feet when we ran into each other outside her cabin.
a07_blackout_anasthetic_captain_01;According to the captain, several people drank from the same bottle. So the sedative must have been in the glass and not in the bottle. Captain DiConti says he gave me Doctor Gebhardt's glass. So maybe the real target wasn't me but rather the doctor?
index_note_traces_01;Clues and Evidence
a07_traces_pistol_01;Legrand and the constable found the murder weapon on the gangway on the hull. Maybe the murderer wanted to dispose of it without being detected and had the bad luck that he didn't know the ship well enough. But there's something that seems off to me. If I was a murderer and I wanted to make an important piece of evidence disappear, I'd make damn sure it really did disappear.
a07_traces_projectil_doctor_01;The bullet that Doctor Gebhardt removed from the Baroness' heart is a 7.65mm Parabellum from a Luger pistol.
a07_traces_pillow_01;I found a scorched pillow in the baroness' cabin. It looks like it was used to muffle the sound of a gunshot. The shooter then stuffed it into a vase because he didn't want to get caught with it. \n The strange thing is: we all heard the gunshot!
a07_traces_projectiles_01;The murder weapon is David Kreutzer's Luger 08. Both bullets, the one removed from the baroness' corpse and the one from the cargo hold, came from the violinist's gun.
a07_traces_light_blood_01;I took special note of the blood on the baroness' bed. Something's not right. It's so... so red. After so many hours exposed to the air it should be browner...
a07_traces_blood_checked_01;It's not blood at all! I tested it and it's not blood! It's some kind of red liquid that looks like fresh blood — but not like 12-hour-old blood. Why didn't Doctor Gebhardt notice? He had to have noticed that something wasn't right!
a07_traces_tape_01;I found a reel of audiotape in the medical facility. There's a recording of a gunshot on it! I'd wager that it's the shot we all heard last night.
index_note_museum_01;Museum
a10_museum_first_01;The museum is closed to the public today. And only invited guests will be allowed to attend the gala tonight. I think that's when the Raven will strike — assuming I'm right and in that he's still roaming free.
a10_museum_treasury_01;The Eye of the Sphinx is housed in a bulletproof display case. Everything is electronically alarmed. The museum's security system is state of the art, no question.
a10_museum_telephone_01;The telephone lines are dead. We can't call for help.
index_note_director_01;The Museum Director
a10_director_museum_first_01;Director Mokhtar seems to believe that Legrand caught Doctor Gebhardt. Someone tipped off the newspapers and mixed up some of the key details.
a10_director_after_legrand_01;Dr. Mokhtar no doubt felt he had better things to do than give a lowly flatfoot like myself a tour of his museum. I think he prefers the movers and shakers. Important, rich and famous people — that's more his thing.
a10_director_after_explosion_01;I think Dr. Mokhtar is in a state of shock. And no wonder: his museum's treasure chamber was just blown to smithereens, after all. I'll give him a chance to collect himself.
a11_director_talk_basement_01;Dr. Mokhtar maintains that he knows nothing about basements and secret passages. That may very well be true, but someone should still check how long he's been here. If he was working here twenty years ago, during the war, then his claims are suspect. 
index_note_escape_raven_01;The Raven's escape route
a10_escape_raven_after_explosion_01;There was an explosion! The security system locked down both the museum and the treasure chamber right away. I don't know what happened there, but I fear my foe is going to work with a chainsaw rather than a scalpel this time. \n We're trapped in the museum. And so is the Raven, unless he has another way out — which I suspect he does. I have to follow him!
a11_escape_raven_treasury_01;Parts of the treasure chamber have been destroyed. There's less damage than I feared, but some of the artworks are lost forever. The Raven didn't have a way out of the treasure chamber, so he made one. There's a gaping hole where the Eye of the Sphinx and its display case once stood.
a11_escape_raven_secretdoor_01;There's a secret basement below the treasure chamber. From there, a hidden door leads to the main hall. The basement has been here since the museum was built. The secret door may have been added later, during WWII. That would explain the cursing statue that Matt heard. Someone was here in the basement, probably preparing the explosives, while I was talking to Lady Westmacott.
a11_escape_raven_secretdoor_02;There's another secret door in the basement. The Raven must have used it! Unfortunately, it's locked. There are rotating disks with various animal symbols. There's also something written in Arabic:
a11_escape_raven_after_explosion_04;According to Dr. Mokhtar, it says: “The Sons of Horus”. Each of the four sons has a symbol: man, baboon, jackal and falcon. They decorate burial vessels — the famous canopic jars. 
index_note_start_2_01;A Few Notes
a12_start_2_inch_01;It took a while, but Inch finally hired me. I'm supposed to do the dirty work for him. So be it. I'll be near him, and that's what matters. Sooner or later he'll go for the big score!
a12_start_2_eyes_01;The Eyes of the Sphinx! Not a bad choice. They're two of the most valuable jewels in the world and definitely worthy of the Raven. I'm supposed to steal the first jewel from the British Museum. Inch has ensured that the alarms in part of the museum will be shut off. He has exceptional contacts.
a12_start_2_plan_01;The plan was for me to swap the Eye of the Sphinx with a dummy without anyone noticing. “Unfortunately”, a guard and a bobby stumbled upon me before I had a chance to plant the fake. Everything was going according to plan... If you ignore the fact that Inch set off a bomb to eliminate the pair. I could have escaped just fine on my own, without the spectacle and without risking anyone's life.
index_note_inch_01;Inch
a12_inch_start_01;Getting close to Inch was no picnic. He has a lot of helpers but he keeps himself in the background. That's what makes it so difficult to catch him—he never gets his own hands dirty. He lets others do the work. People like me. \n It's my luck that he needs someone to replace his injured arm. Otherwise, I'd never have gotten so close to him.
a12_inch_talk_station_01;Inch still doesn't really trust me. Doesn't matter. I'm right where I want to be. And as long as Inch takes me for an enthusiastic but not all that bright wannabe thief, everything will be fine.
a14_inch_bomb_01;A bomb! He set off a damned bomb to get rid of Legrand and the others. I didn't think he had it in him. He's more unscrupulous than I thought possible. One more reason to take him out as soon as possible. \n Should I just give the police a tip and put an end to things that way? I would if I thought they could really help. But Inch has to be caught red-handed or else he'll just slip away unscathed.
a17_inch_talk_cell_01;I have a very bad feeling about this. It seems like Inch knows more than he should. Has he found out about me? Or about Alex? Our plan? \n Alex wouldn't like it, but I can't help worrying about her.
a19_inch_start_01;Alex wouldn't like it, but I can't help worrying about her.
index_note_inchs_plan_01;Inch's Plan
a12_inchs_plan_talk_station_01;We wanted to steal the first Eye in London without anyone noticing. Only after the second Eye was stolen in Cairo would anyone take a closer look at the first one and notice that it was a fake. I never actually planned on leaving the fake behind — but then, Inch didn't follow his own plan either. He certainly never mentioned a bomb in a wastebasket. \n And now this business with the letter — I've no idea what that's about. What part of the plan will he change next? 
a14_inchs_plan_talk_pier_01;Inch still hasn't let me in on his plans — and it seems like he's not going to either. I expected as much, but I still don't like it.
a19_inchs_plan_start_01;Murdering Doctor Gebhardt is unforgivable, no matter what he's guilty of. All the same, I have to hand it to Inch: he wrote the confession and then notified the press. The message that the real Raven had been caught must have made waves all the way to Paris. Legrand will be busy all day with his government, the Egyptian authorities and the press. And so Inch thinks he's taken his most dangerous opponent out of the equation.
a20_inchs_plan_left_ravennest_01;Inch's plan just might work. I'll steal the Eye and the gate to the treasure chamber will keep the guards at bay until I get back to the roof. Everyone will think that I fled using the fire ladder, when really I'll use the secret door to reenter the museum and wait there until things calm down. \n But none of that really matters. Inch has other plans. And so do we!
index_note_my_part_01;My Role
a13_my_part_talk_doctor_01;A successful thief is one who can blend into a crowd, someone you don't notice. In that sense, I'm not predestined to be a thief: I stand out, at least in these parts. It's only people's prejudices that protect me. They'd expect me to snatch a purse but no one would take me for a master thief.
a17_my_part_first_01;The poor, naïve Arabian day laborer: one of my most successful characters. I'm Spanish and I don't actually speak Arabic, but no one's caught on yet. People just look right through you if you don't belong to their class or their race. Rather than an individual, you're taken for part of a group, a crowd — and it's easy to get lost in a crowd.
index_note_alex_01;Alex
a15_alex_end15_01;“She's the best thing that ever happened to me.” I never understood that expression until Alex happened. It's a... strange feeling. You suddenly have the feeling that someone else is just as important, or more important, than your own life. Suddenly, you're not thinking, “what do I want,” but rather, “what does she want”. Or better yet, “what do we want”. \n We met in the south of France. The rich daughter from a good family and the Arab waiter from her hotel. Neither of us were what we appeared to be, and we both noticed it soon enough. Birds of a feather. \n “Patricia Mayers” was the role she was playing then too. I think she likes Patricia. Alex is very smart, and Patricia Mayers is a vacation from that intelligence.
index_note_adil_01;Adil
a16_adil_start_01;What I like about him isn't his good looks. And not that he's a skilled thief, that he's clever or that he loves me. It's his character. He has many reasons to be cynical or bitter, but he's not. He enjoys life. He sees the positive in all people and every situation. He's humble and can find joy in small things. \n I never thought about children until I met him. He'd be a fantastic father. He'd teach our children to have a positive outlook on life. Not to let circumstances grind them down. He'd give them everything they need to live satisfying lives.
index_note_plan_01;The Plan
a16_plan_talk_about_01;Our plan is simple: in London I'll swap the stolen Eye of the Sphinx for a fake. Inch might take a quick look at the stone but he won't have a chance to check it thoroughly and hopefully won't notice anything amiss. We'll grab the second gem in Cairo. Inch will think that he's got everything under control... By the time he catches on, we'll be long gone. 
a16_plan_corps_seen_01;That's not part of the plan! Not at all. Who shot the baroness? Inch? But why? This is not good. Not good at all.
a16_plan_arab_arrested_01;Adil's been caught. A dangerous situation. If they don't find the murderer, they might try to blame it on him. And even if they don't, it could be days before he's released!
a19_plan_start_01;The murder of Baroness von Trebitz was an unwelcome distraction. But I have the feeling that the plan is back on track. Inch thinks he's in control. His end is drawing near.
a20_plan_left_ravensnest_01;Nothing will happen to her. Nothing can be allowed to happen to her! I hate that I can't be with her. She can take care of herself, I know. But Alex, alone with that nut? I can't let myself think about it. I have to concentrate on my job. 
index_note_mayers_01;Patricia Mayers
a16_mayers_talk_arab_plan_01;Patricia Mayers is one of my favorite characters. A pretty daughter from a good family... No one expects — or suspects — anything of her. There's only one problem... People who think Patricia is dumb, even though they don't know her, sometimes annoy me so much that I can't help myself. A dumb spoiled blonde who's always ready with a clever retort — not the best cover. I need to work on that.
a16_mayers_talk_fiddler_01;It's incredible. Patricia really draws people out in conversations. I don't know why. Maybe because they see her as harmless... Maybe they want to shock her. But it happens time and again: people pour their hearts out to me when I play Patricia. Doesn't happen nearly as often when I'm Alex. Then people treat me with more... respect? Caution? 
index_note_doctor_baroness_01;The Doctor and the Baroness
a17_doctor_baroness_dialog_butler_01;Doctor Gebhardt murdered Baroness von Trebitz? What did they have to do with one another? The doctor was anything but likeable — just like the baroness, really... But unless they met at Unlikeables Anonymous, I don't know where they could possibly know each other from. 
a18_doctor_baroness_story_01;A terrible story. A man whose love is not returned and so he throws all morals aside to take revenge. The baroness must have been away at university at the time. That's all that saved her from being murdered with the rest of her family. She seems to have known Gebhardt from photos... The friend of the family, their savior, who had an eye for the baroness' younger sister. She saw him boarding the ship in Venice. Maybe she wasn't certain if it really was him, or maybe she wanted some proof. She searched for a photo, found it, and then wanted to expose the doctor during the reception in the saloon. Unfortunately, the doctor recognized her as well and realized immediately that she could destroy the new life he'd built for himself after the war.
a18_doctor_baroness_doctor_dead_01;Sooner or later, people will find out that Doctor Gebhardt couldn't have been the Raven. He'll turn out to have an alibi for one or another of the thefts. But it could be days or even weeks until that happens. The thefts took place in many different countries stretching back fifteen years. \n Maybe they'll find his body, but I doubt it. Doctor Gebhardt — and whoever he was before that — is dead.
